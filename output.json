["The case for paid-for mobile games makes Google\u2019s Fortnite series more valuable for the company\u2019s bottom line. | AI generated article*", "When Google launched its Fortnite series in 2010, the gaming industry was in a creative slump. As major mobile game developers like Epic Games and Trey Parker\u2019s Dreamworks put their creative stamp on the genre, they helped prove that there\u2019s a demand for \u2014 and a need for \u2014 high-quality, simple game designs. Each year, more and more consumers are buying games on mobile and desktop, putting more and more pressure on the publishers to keep prices low. That inevitably results in more advertisements, which leads to more profit for the company.", "Fortnite became a cultural touchstone, a place to which everyone could feel their power. A major chunk of the franchise \u2014 which includes episodes that practically sprung from the ground \u2014 was dedicated to celebrating the iconic maps and their distinctive aesthetics. Fans of the franchise took to the internet to find fanart, try to recreate maps made for the real world in virtual reality, and even find maps that weren\u2019t fully realized yet.", "But when the series came to mobile, things changed. The barrier of entry was much lower thanks to Google\u2019s All Access content plan. And there was a fundamental hitch: Google didn\u2019t want anyone, including casual players, to play the game on their phones. As Anthony has explained in his two-year study about the subject, the company felt threatened by the very notion of a smartphone-native game.", "\u201cThey really were sticking to the restrictive older technology of the NES, which made playing on the NES more expensive and less accessible. And we have those issues with game engines, so we had to port the game into their new platforms, which very much limits their capabilities.\u201dThe first step for a mobile game, then, was to port the game to the iPhone. The only logical decision would be to do it natively as opposed to using the cloud.", "Game engines are usually built to be used for one specific game engine, like a PlayStation or Xbox. In the past, companies worked with graphic card manufacturers to optimize graphics for one platform or another and then partner that game with existing siliconized game engines. Such arrangements can include blockbuster AAA games like Unreal, which are often built to be used with existing siliconized game engines, or user-created games that use a standard engine but use a mobile game engine to draw them.", "Today, much of the computationally intensive workstation work is done by the graphics card, and the most accessible and popular mobile game engines are Unity and Unreal Engine. But while these may be good choices for most people, it would be nice if Google could come up with an algorithm that could automatically fit some new kind of game onto the front page without departing from the fundamentals of the aesthetic experience.", "The simplest, and arguably most elegant solution would be to use the GPU in combination with the MEMORY bus, letting users create more imaginative 3D animated objects, or even play games with a 3D printer. Google\u2019s vision for the future of games might be summed up by the paper trail: simply write down what you\u2019re drawing on your tablet or phone, then draw another line drawing that object. Don\u2019t worry, there will be a visual feedback system. Touch the image in the top right corner to start drawing.", "Game engines are getting more sophisticated, but they\u2019re all based on a programming model loosely akin to that of an academic programming textbook. The most common ones can already calculate motions, rotations, and other transformations before you see them. The most powerful mobile game engine, Epic, understands rotation and translation already, but it\u2019s the combination of these two factors that makes the game so satisfying. You touch the image in the top right corner to start drawing. It\u2019s hard to describe, but that\u2019s just how well built the engine is.", "If you try a few of these simple examples, you will see how intuitive it is to draw something on your screen, and how powerful the possibilities are. In fact, your imagination will be blown. In fact, you might be surprised how much you can already imagine things in your mind.Interacting with external objects", "Let\u2019s take the classic line of thought: that our visual cortex is the visual cortex. What this means for game engines is that they need to process what we see in our eyes before we think about actions, and then drive those actions into the game. In other words, they need to be in sync.Fundamental video games don\u2019t just look and play great \u2014 they can be creative, too.", "*This article was written by a GPT-2 neural network.
